                <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning 
                in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections 
                (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.
                </p>
                <p>Elements consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A tag name</li>
                <li>Required or optional attributes</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="element.png" alt="element">
        </main>
        <article>
            <p>It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted. In this HTML each nested 
                element is indented by four spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. It is up to you to choose the style of 
                formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for example).</p>
            <p>In Visual Studio Code, you can automatically format your code by following these steps:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Type ctrl-shift-p (windows) or cmd-shift-p (mac) to open the Command Palette</li>
                <li>In the Command Palette, type format</li>
                <li>From the results, choose Format Document</li>
            </ol>
        </article>

            <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users. It can be used for very basic document text 
                styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — 
                for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related 
                information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.</p>
            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular 
                elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
